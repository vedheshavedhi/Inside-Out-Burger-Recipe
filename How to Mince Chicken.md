1-  Rinse chicken pieces under cold running water, then pat them dry with paper towels.
2-  Remove the skin, tendons and fat from the chicken pieces. If you are using dark meat or bone-in white meat, cut the flesh away from away from the bones.
3-  Lay theskinned and trimmed chicken pieces on a cutting board. Chop the chicken flesh into 2-inch cubes that are as uniform as possible.
4-  Put a few handfuls of the chicken cubes into a food processor. Pulse the chicken in brief bursts until the pieces come to a mince that is either coarse or fine, depending on your preference. Avoid over-processing the chicken to a ground consistency.
5-  Repeat with any remaining chicken. Working in small batches ensures an even mince.
