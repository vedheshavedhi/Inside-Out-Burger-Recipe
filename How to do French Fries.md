1-  Slice the potatoes into thick sticks. Using a French fry cutter makes this much easier.
2-  Soak the potato slices in cold water for a minimum of one hour, and up to overnight. The longer, the better as this process removes the starch which makes for extra crispy fries.
3-  Rinse the fries twice with cold water.
4-  Lay the fries on paper towel or a clean dishcloth and pat them as dry as possible.
5-  Heat oil in a deep fryer or dutch oven to 300 degrees F. You'll need to fry in about six batches, begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed. Frying too many at once makes them less crispy.
6-  Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to the oil and fry for about 5-6 minutes. The oil should bubble lightly, we're only heating the potatoes, we don't want them to crisp yet.
7-  Place the cooked potatoes on a paper on a paper towel lined plate and fry the rest of the remaining batches.
8-  Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and fry each batch a second time until they are crsip and golden-brown, about 5 minutes or so.
9-  Remove them and place them on dry paper towels. Sprinkles with salt as soon as they come out.
10- Serve with ketchup or fry sauce and enjoy!
